    <h2>Hello.</h2>
    <p>I gratuaded as a power engineer. In 2021, after finishing my major degree at FEIT at university of Žilina i have begun working for transmission system operator SEPS, where've started coming into contact with programming regularly. My first scripts were built in Microsoft's Visual Basic (VBA), mostly some automatization, data manipulation etc. Later, I started using python. I expanded my knowledge by taking online courses and working on simple projects.</p>

      <h3>Programing</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p >I mainly acquire programming knowledge by working in my spare time. My python skills are at a moderately advanced level. The functionality of python projects i stretched by adding databases, (Postgresql and sqlite) using pycopg2 module. Creating GUI in pyqt6, web scraping, API, Git/GitHub etc. Also some html and css.</p>

      <h3>Motivation</h3>
      <p>My work at SEPS mainly focuses on security of the transmission system and i also do a little bit of market trade. I communicate daily in English with our partners abroad. Most of my work-days consist of 12-hour shifts, day and night (safety of the transmission grid has to be assessed even at night :) ) Due to this, I have a lot of free time. And I am really interested in doing some part-time job in the IT field. Preferably full remote and up to 20 hours a week.
        </p>
      <p>I genuinely like programming, either in python or any other language. I am a young, single person who wants to work on him self in terms of my career, broaden my scope of skills and be attractive candidate in the labor market. </p>
